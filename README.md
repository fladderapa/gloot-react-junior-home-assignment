# Gloot react junior home assignment by Alex

It tooked more time then estimated, i spent a whole day with the project.
I hade some unexpected headache trying to load in the images but solved it
eventually with ImageBase64Plugin (never used fuse before).

Could maybe done it more responsive and used a framework for styling, but decided
to draw the line here. Anyway here's my contribution (i hope it's not too messy!) 🙂✌️

## Prerequisites:

- No packages added
- No frameworks used
